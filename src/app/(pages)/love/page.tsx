          We met in a classroom full of dreams, at Vidyamandir, when life was still drawing its outlines â€” and somehow, between pages of notebooks and shared glances, your presence began to mean more than I could have imagined.
          <br /><br />
          Since then, every moment with you has unfolded like a quiet miracle. We&apos;ve walked through laughter and quiet tears, through unexpected milestones and unplanned memories, collecting small pieces of forever with each step.
          <br /><br />
          Whether it was simple conversations or silent companionship, every second with you stitched itself into my heart like the soft hum of our favorite song â€” <em>Mrignayani</em> â€” a tune that now plays in the background of everything I do.
          <br /><br />
          You&apos;ve been my calm in chaos, my fire when I flicker, and the one who makes the ordinary feel magical.
          We&apos;ve grown together, changed, discovered pieces of ourselves we didnâ€™t know existed â€” and through it all, your love has been the most grounding and beautiful part of my world.
          <br /><br />
          In your eyes, Iâ€™ve found home; in your soul, Iâ€™ve felt peace.
          Every moment shared, every word, every silence â€” it all adds up to a love I never want to live without.
